I will use Algorithms to solve pretty much anything in life, it's not just in Computer Science. Algorithms are just a method of problem
solving when it comes to difficult situations. Sometimes when you perform an algorithm, it might work. But other times the algorithm
isn't working and you have to switch to something else. Don't ever give up, there will be a way to solve something no matter how hard. If
it's too hard, you can ask for some help.
